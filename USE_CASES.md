# log-hindsight Use Case and Implementation Ideas
This is a list of creative use cases for log-hindsight, with general ideas for how to implement them. This is intended to inspire and guide the development of log-hindsight, and to help users understand the potential of the module. The bullet items are mostly high-level feature ideas, and what gets implemented first will be guided by user input.

Many of the bullet points below are not yet implemented, and are intended to guide future development. The module is currently in a pre-release state, and the interface is very likely to change until the first minor release.

### Cost-Effective Log Management
A small startup is challenged by the high costs of log storage and analysis. They use log-hindsight to only send warning and error messages to storage, plus when an error occurs on a mission critical service it logs the full log history. This approach helps in managing costs effectively while ensuring essential logs are not missed.
- Implement dynamic log level based on a configurable GET API response.
- Give code examples for using cloud storage APIs for real-time usage monitoring.
- Support rule prioritization to ensure mission critical log lines are always captured.

### Real-Time User Experience Monitoring
A web application team wants to enhance user experience proactively. They configure log-hindsight to increase logging detail for user sessions that exhibit slow performance or timeout errors. This targeted logging helps in quickly identifying and addressing UX issues, leading to improved user satisfaction.
- Adjust log level based on user experience metrics like response times.
- Trigger detailed logging for sessions encountering performance issues.
- Supports real-time UX analysis by writing performance stats for the slowest sessions.

### Security Breach Analysis
Following a security breach, a security analyst uses log-hindsight to backtrack and analyze the incident. They configure log-hindsight to retroactively increase log detail for the affected time period and endpoints. This detailed log data is crucial for understanding the breach's scope and preventing future incidents.
- Enable retroactive log detail enhancement for specific time periods.
- Focus logging on endpoints or areas suspected to be compromised.
- Support longer retention periods by buffering logs in redis or cloud storage.
- Provide log data for rapid investigation and analysis of affected endpoints.

### Debugging in Microservices Architecture
In a microservices architecture, a developer struggles with debugging an issue due to the distributed nature of logs. They use log-hindsight to limit detailed logging to the endpoint they're debugging in their staging environment and resolve it efficiently.
- Implement method for log-hindsight rule injection based on json input.
- Support creation of custom endpoints to dynamically add or remove log write rules.
- Support filtering and searching logs based on transaction IDs or other custom fields.

### Retain Compliance Audit Logs
To prepare for a compliance audit, a company needs to ensure all relevant logs are easily accessible and auditable. They use log-hindsight to tag and prioritize logs related to compliance, simplifying the audit process and ensuring that all necessary logs are retained and easily retrievable.
- Option to add tags or fields to log lines based on custom matching function.
- Statistics recorded based on custom matching function.
- Support rule to extend log line retention period based on custom matching function.

### Informed Customer Support
A customer support agent needs detailed information to resolve a user's issue. They activate a "Detailed Logs" feature in their support dashboard, triggering log-hindsight to provide a historical log dump and continue detailed logging for that user's session. This immediate access to detailed logs enables the agent to quickly understand and address the user's problem.
- Add write condition for a custom log field like user_id.
- Implement time period-based write conditions.
- Support log line writes to a custom endpoint, such as a customer service database.
